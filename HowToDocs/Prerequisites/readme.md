## STM32 Cube Programmer

ST provide a tool for deploying software to the STM32 family of boards.  STM32CubeProg can be downloaded from the [ST website](http://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html).

Once installed it is advised that the path to _STM32_Programmer_CLI.exe_ is added to the system PATH variable.  This will allow the firmware to be flashed to the Netduino from a batch file.
